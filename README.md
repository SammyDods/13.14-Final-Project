# Zombinator - Zombie PyGame

### Currently refactoring the code, for a functional version please checkout the origonal commit.

A shooter/strategy zombie game using the Pygame python module

I adapted the sprite animation, movement, and bullets from http://programarcadegames.com/index.php
This website was where I learned most of my pygame, and I could not have built this project without it.

NCS Chasing ghosts was used as music

You're a space marine trying to survive never ending waves of zombies. As the waves progress the zombies gain more health and eventually zombie tanks will spawn. You can use WASD to move, and your mouse to shoot. By killing zombies you earn cash, wish you can then use on either buying suit upgrades (for increased damage) or buildings (with various bonuses). The buildings include banks (providing passive cashflow) and walls (walls will stop zombies from advancing until the walls run out of hp and can be shot through).

Use q to interact with the various buildings, p to pause.
